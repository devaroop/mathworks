MathWorks Kids Game

I want to develop a learning game, which takes  collection of numbers and based on the constraint it gives filtered numbers

Story 1 – As a kid learning mathematics, I want to be able to identify prime numbers, so that I can grow my understanding of prime numbers.

Input – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
Output – 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 

Story 2 – As a kid learning mathematics, I want to be able to identify odd numbers, so that I can grow my understanding of odd numbers.

Input – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
Output – 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15

Story 3 – As a kid learning mathematics, I want to be able to identify odd prime numbers, so that I can grow my understanding of numbers.

Input – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
Output – 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

Story 4 – As a kid learning mathematics, I want to be able to identify numbers that are between 5 and 10, so that I can grow my understanding of numbers.

Input – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
Output – 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Story 5 – As a kid learning mathematics, I want to be able to identify odd primes that are between 2 and 31, so that I can grow my understanding of numbers.

Input – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35
